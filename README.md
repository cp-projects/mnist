# mnist


This repository is dedicated to Machine Learning algorithms to read and interpret the MNIST database data. First focus is on building an Artificial Neural Network for supervised learning in C++. My goal is to continue to build a foundational understanding of Machine Learning rather than practical application. The first ANN is loosely based on/inspired by the 3blue1brown YouTube series, Neural Networks from the Ground Up.
